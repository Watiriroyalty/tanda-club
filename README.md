# tanda-club

A tanda-style loan club with a variable number of participants.
A tanda is a rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA) for a group of people who know one another.
The members of the group get together regularly to contribute an agreed-upon amount of money to a pool that is then given to one of the members. 
It's a way for participants to get an interest-free loan or force themselves to save money, perhaps for a large purchase.


How Does a Tanda Work?
Members of the tanda agree on how much money they will all contribute, how regularly they will do so, and for how long. The order in which people are paid may be established ahead of time or the recipient of the cash on a given week may be chosen at random.

For people who receive money early in the cycle, a tanda effectively acts as a short-term, no-interest loan. For those who receive payouts in the middle of the cycle, it's a way to plan and save up for a large purchase. For those near the end of the cycle, it provides social pressure to keep setting aside money.


As an example, 10 friends and family members may agree to contribute $100 a month for 10 months. Each member of the tanda would get $1,000 in one of those months.
